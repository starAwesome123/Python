# ⏱️ PyQt5 Stopwatch

A simple and elegant digital stopwatch application built with Python and the PyQt5 framework. This project demonstrates key GUI development concepts, including event handling with `QTimer`, layout management, and dynamic button states.

## ✨ Features

* **Real-time Timer:** The stopwatch updates in real-time with millisecond precision.

* **Intuitive Controls:** Simple "Start," "Stop," and "Reset" buttons for easy use.
